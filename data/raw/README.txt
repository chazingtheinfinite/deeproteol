ProteoLSTM README

The original protein sequence data were downloaded from Uniprot.
Each organism's proteome was initially obtained:
Homo Sapiens:			UP000005640
Saccharamyces cerevisiae:	UP000002311
Mus musculus:			UP000000589
Arabidopsis thaliana:		UP000006548
Caenorhabditis elegans: 	UP000001940

Only "Reviewed" proteins were selected and downloaded as a Tab-separated file with the following fields:
<Uniprot Id>\t<Protein Name>\t<GO Terms>\t<Sequence Length>\t<Sequence in AA>\n
