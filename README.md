The complete proteomes for five organisms was downloaded along with their Gene Ontology (GO) term annotations. Of course, the analyses performed in this work are easily extensible to include other organisms. Only proteins desingated as "Reviewed" were included to avoid introducing noisy or unconfirmed annotations.
